# Workspace_C_Introduction

This workspace is designed for educational purposes, showcasing a series of programming exercises, tutorials, and practical works (PW) completed in a College C Programming Class. Each part of this workspace represents a different aspect of learning C, from basic exercises to more complex projects.

## Structure

The workspace is organized into different sections, each containing specific C files related to the topic or task:

### Practice 1
- `cube.c`: **First Exercise in College C Programming Class**
  - This program calculates the cube of a number and is the first exercise given in the college C programming class.

### TUT_1
- `TUT_1.c`: **First Tutorial in College C Programming Class**
  - This file contains code from the first tutorial (or recitation session) of the C programming class, focusing on fundamental concepts and simple programming tasks.

### PW_1
- `PW_1.c`: **First Practical Work in College C Programming Class**
  - The first practical work (or lab session) in the course, where students apply the concepts learned in lectures to more practical, hands-on programming tasks.

### PW_2
#### Part_1 (Hangman project)
- `main.c`: **Practical Work 2 in C Programming Course**
  - The main file for the second practical work, which is part of a project to create a simple Hangman game.
- `hangman.c`
- `hangman.h`
  - These files together make up the Hangman game, demonstrating more advanced programming techniques such as modular design and file organization.

#### Part_2 (Calculator project)
- `main.c`: **Second Part of the Practical Work in C Programming**
  - The main file for the second part of the practical work, focusing on a calculator project that showcases the use of functions, user input, and conditional statements.
- `standard.c`
- `standard.h`
  - These files contain the implementation of a standard calculator with basic arithmetic operations.
- `scientific.c`
- `scientific.h`
  - These files expand the calculator project to include a scientific calculator with more complex functions like trigonometric operations, exponentials, and logarithms.

## Overview

The workspace progresses from simple exercises to more complex projects, allowing students to build a strong foundation in C programming. It covers various aspects of the language, including basic syntax, control structures, functions, and modular programming. The Hangman game and Calculator project serve as capstone experiences that integrate and apply these skills in a practical context.
